\begin{abstract}
  The growing spiritual and cultural requirements the blind need to be met. 
  However, barrier-free cultural products take a long time to prepare and are concentrated in more developed cities, they cannot be widespread to those in need. 
  Here we show the pipeline to translate books for the visually impaired mainly with Optical Character Recognition(OCR) and Image Caption(IC) technique. 
  Our work demonstrates how to solve this problem using existing technology and our result can build the foundation of this task. 
  We anticipate our pipeline to be a starting point of research in translating books for the visually impaired and we hope we can bring light to the blind.
